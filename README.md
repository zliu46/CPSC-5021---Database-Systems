Final Grade: 

Your final grade will be calculated as noted above.  Students should resist asking the teacher to alter their grade, as the instructor will respect the grade boundaries that are shown. 

Homework Assignments: 

All HW assignments are due on the indicated due date. Please look at the LATE HOMEWORK POLICY that is in this syllabus.

HW Assignments are usually every other week, and students would be not to postpone this task. HW Assignments will likely take up to 50% of the total time spent outside of the class, and it is not unreasonable to think that could be up to 10 hours for a two week assignment. Keep in mind that you are usually doing the Main project in parallel (which could also take up to 5-10 hours per week).

HW assignments may have an extra credit option. Credit will only be granted in the condition that the regular score was 85%

Programs will be graded according to a set of standard criteria, including but not limited to functionality, documentation and style. A rubric detailing the requirements will be posted on the course website with each assignment.

Zybooks: 

We will have eight Zybook assignments to accompany our course content. They are usually participation online activities. More will be discussed on the first week of class. You will be asked to 'join" Zybooks on your first assignment, and join Zybooks. It may ask for the specific database section you have (01 or 02). It is a $58.00 charge. It is mandatory, and it is similar to a textbook, but it is interactive. 

Interactive Class Exercises (ICE):

Breakout activities are "hands-on" activities that accompany the lecture. Each week there is a breakout sheet that student groups will work on during class. It is not intended to be done outside of class (unless they want), as there should be sufficient time. Each week, students will have a different breakout group. They can look at the people tab to find out which group they belong to. There will be an in-class assignment that is usually 2-3 different tasks related to lecture. One member of the group will turn in a PDF that is based on the tasks for that week. 

Group Project:

You will be part of a 3-4 person group that will have three separate group assignments (Milestone1, Milestone2, Milestone3). You will deliver a complete database, along with a Java Program that you access this database. In addition, you will provide design models that we will learn about in class.

Quizzes:

Quizzes will be given every other week. Quizzes will cover material covered in class and in Coronel book.  

There is usually one essay type question that you will have to solve. This question is usually worth 10 points. 

Midterm & Final Exams:

There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. All exams are closed-book, and one page/one sided notes. No electronics of any kind (other than your computer usage to take the quiz.) 

The exam is timed, and must be taken when it is scheduled. If a diagram is asked for, you may draw the image "free-hand" on a piece of paper, take a picture, and upload it into the Canvas question. If instructor suspects plagiarism, the student will meet with instructor, and consequences will result. Please consult the Academic Integrity manual to review what constitutes plagiarism.

Failure to appear for an exam will result in a score of zero for that test. Makeups will only be given in extraordinary circumstances, at the discretion of the instructor (makeups may be oral).

Quizzes and Assessments (Midterm/Final) may be remote, and it is the instructor's choice of what fits best for class. If it is remote, it will be done as a Canvas Quiz. If it is in class, it will be on paper. 

Grading Scale:

The grade breakdown is shown below.

    A     >= 94%
    A-    >= 90%
    B+   >= 87%
    B     > =83%
    B-    > =80%
    C+   >= 77%
    C     > =73%   
    C-    >= 70%
    D     > =60% 
    F      Below 60%

Class Philosophy:

By design, I am a teacher that feels the best class is hand-on, and that is how the class will operate. I ask for feedback during lecture, and appreciate that dynamic.  The class includes demonstration(s). Usually instructor will demonstrate various tools and often introduce the breakout activities in which student groups will work on assigned problems that are related to the lecture/book material.

Student projects are a large component of the class. Being successful in industry often depends on your ability to function within a team environment, and the database project attempts to give you practice. Instructor will provide team feedback as a result of meeting with teams during office hours, and providing detailed feedback on the various milestone submissions.

I feel strongly that a student must know more than 0's and 1's, and how to manipulate them. It is essential that students obtain a body knowledge in the various companies, technologies, and world events. I will often recommend books, and articles, but feel that the Economist and Wall Street Journal provide what I am looking for. Please get a student subscription for 3 months. You won't be disappointed. 


A normal class will be: (for 6:00 PM class)

3:30-3:40 - Arrive in class for any questions before class starts
3:40-3:55 - Admin/Relevant Topics
3:55-5:00 - Lecture/Demo/Breakout #1
5:00-5:10 - Break
5:10-6:20 - Lecture/Demo/Breakout #2
6:20 - 6:40 - Instructor can meet with individual/groups.

 
Contact:

Contact by email is preferred. Please use good email etiquette - use a proper greeting, include your first and last name in the signature, and put the course number either in the subject or body of the email. Expect a 24-hour response time for emails during business days, or the next business day if the email is sent over the weekend. If there is a legitimate emergency, mark your message as high priority.

Please also feel free to contact me using the course Slack channel by sending a DM or email. Either one is responded to fairly quickly. 
Student Expectations:

Workload Expectations:      

Students are expected to keep up with the course material. As this is a 3 credit class, students should expect to spend  6-10 hours per week outside of class. Students are also responsible for turning in homework on time.  Instructor will take periodic class surveys to make sure workload is not too extreme.

Class Conduct Expectations:

You are responsible for treating other students with respect and to minimize disruptions to the classroom. Examples of classroom disruptions include, but are not limited to: ringing cell phones, using cell phones and laptops in a distracting manner, arriving to class late, leaving class early, and leaving/reentering the classroom.

Class Announcement and Email Expectations:

Students are expected to keep up-to-date on class announcements made outside of class on a daily basis. All class announcements will be made in class and/or via Canvas. By default, Canvas will instantly send these announcements to your SU email address. If desired, you may change the settings on Canvas to send these announcements to an alternative email address.  

It is also important to check your SU email account on a daily basis as private emails initiated by the instructor could be sent to the student’s SU email address. Also, important university announcements (such as the school closing due to inclement weather) are made in this fashion.

Attendance Expectations:

Class attendance is strongly encouraged. Students missing a class are responsible for any material assigned or covered in class during their absence.  Students are encouraged to actively participate in class discussions.  Makeup lectures will not be given during office hours or at any other times.

In the event of an extended absence such as a prolonged illness, it is your responsibility to make up the missing material and catch-up with the remainder of the class as soon as possible. In this situation, to the best of your abilities, keep in contact with me during the absence and schedule a meeting with me once you are back. If an absence causes you to miss several class periods and assignments that make it very difficult for you to catch-up, you will unfortunately have to withdraw from the course.

In accordance with university policy, incomplete grades (I) are only given if an unexpected extended absence occurs at the end of the course session.

Failure to appear for an exam will result in a score of zero for that test. Makeups will only be given in extraordinary circumstances, at the discretion of the instructor, and the students must provide written documentation to the instructor and reserve a make-up time at least 24 hours in advance. Makeups may be oral.

 
Course & University Policies:

Late Homework Policy:

Students are granted one late "pass" per course, where they can submit a HW or Quiz assignment by 11:59pm the next day with no penalty. The "grace period" is exactly 24 hours. For example, if an assignment is due on Tuesday at 11:59 pm, you can submit by Wednesday by 11:59 pm with no penalty if you have a "pass" remaining.  Passes  can only be used for the five distinct HW assignments.

After the pass is used, students will receive a zero on any late submissions.  Assignments that do not follow the submission instructions will receive a zero. Assignments will not be accepted via email.

Missed Class Policy:

If for any reason you miss a class, be sure to obtain notes from one of your peers to catch up. If, after going over those notes and checking the readings for the class, you still have questions, please meet me during office hours or arrange a time to discuss them. Remember to bring those notes with you so that we can work on your specific, focused questions.  

Canceled Class Policy:

If a class is canceled (likely due to inclement weather, instructor illness or loss of internet), the instructor has the right to make up lost class content in an online format. With the online-format, if Internet access is lost, it is likely the class will be made up with 

Electronic Submission Policy:

Homework assignments (or portions of homework assignments) will be required to be submitted electronically via Canvas. Submission details will be provided in the assignments. While a solution can be submitted multiple times, only the last submission will be graded as previous submissions are overwritten.  Be sure to double-check your solutions as assignments will only be graded once after the due date. Any assignments (or portions of homework assignments) that are required to be submitted electronically, must be submitted electronically. Assignments submitted using other means, including email submissions, will not be accepted.

Grading Dispute Policy:

If you feel something was graded incorrectly or a math error occurred when tabulating the total score of an exam or assignment, please contact me. All grading disputes must be sent in writing via email. In most cases, I will review the case. In some cases, I will ask to meet with you during office hours in order to resolve the issue. Grading disputes will only be accepted for one week; the timing of the week starts when the exam or assignment grade was first available to the student (either online or in-person). Note that I will often re-grade the assignment, which potentially could result in additional deductions to maintain consistency with the grading of all student assignments.

Support for Students with Disabilities:

If you have, or think you may have, a disability (including an “invisible disability” such as a learning disability, a chronic health problem, or a mental health condition) that interferes with your performance as a student in this class, you are encouraged to arrange support services and/or accommodations through Disabilities Services staff located in Loyola 100, (206) 296-5740. Disability-based adjustments to course expectations can be arranged only through this process.

Academic Integrity Policy: 

Students, unless specifically stated otherwise, are required to do all work in this course individually. Students may discuss general concepts with other students, but may not discuss assignment or implementation details with other students; please address detail/implementation questions to the TAs or the instructor. Submitted work must be original work done by the student. However, you may use class material without citation. Class material includes information that was presented in class, discussed during office hours, that appears in the textbook or lecture notes, or was provided by me (or any guest instructor). The use of external sources such as other books, open source, or the Internet must be approved by the instructor and must be cited before submitting the assignment. 

If you are in doubt whether a particular activity may be considered cheating, ask the instructor.  In addition, you are encouraged to consult the Academic Integrity Tutorial

Links to an external site..  A common act of plagiarism if "copying" an answer from a Wikipedia article or even the book. It is up to student to answer the question, and use their own words. An easy way to avoid plagiarism is to provide your own simple example when answering a question (essay or a distinct problem). 

Any evidence of plagiarism, collaboration, or other cheating will result in a zero for all parties concerned for the assignment or exam in question. In addition, all academic integrity violations will be reported according to the Seattle University Academic Integrity Policy. That process may enforce additional penalties and/or disciplinary action.  Please consult the Academic Integrity Policy (2011-3) for further information.

Academic Resources:

My goal is to create a learning environment in which you can be incredibly successful. I will work hard to create and improve the learning environment throughout the quarter based on my own observations of the course and your feedback on what would help you learn more. In return, I ask and encourage you to make the most of this learning opportunity. Please take advantage of the academic support services available to you at the university. Even if you have had excellent study skills in the past, it is easy to slip into suboptimal habits and these services can help you excel in your studies.

All work submitted for grading must be the student's own work. Plagiarism will result in a score of zero on the test or assignment, or dismissal from the course. Also, the Dean of Students office will be informed.

COMMUNITY & INCLUSIVITY:

Seattle University has a stated commitment to diversity and inclusivity. In part, this includes an expectation that all members of our campus community treat one another with respect and care in the classroom. Actions or statements which espouse the supremacy of one group of people over another, or which marginalize any group, are not welcome in our classroom. Such attitudes are destructive to both our learning process and our community. All students in this course are welcomed and valued.

Racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, religious prejudice, and other forms of discrimination have no place on our campus or in our classroom. Our class, like our campus, is one community. We learn together. We work together. And we will respect one another. We teach all students, regardless of background or beliefs. All students are equally welcome and valued. Growth mindset includes our ability to grow together, to learn to be more tolerant, and to become more compassionate. No one is being asked to leave the table. Everyone is being asked to make room at the table, so that everyone has a seat and a fair chance.

If you find that anything in our class is failing to live up to these principles (including if you feel that I myself have failed to live up to them), I encourage you to bring this issue up, either to me, or to your department chair, your advisor, advisors in the College of Science and Engineering Advising Center, or another faculty or staff member you feel comfortable talking with, who could pass on your concerns to myself or my department chair.  You are also invited to reach out to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Student Ambassadors on Instagram @su_stemdei. 

 

OFFICE OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY

Seattle University students who have concerns of discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, or related retaliation, are encouraged to contact the Office of Institutional Equity(OIE) or one of the other options listed on the OIE's website
